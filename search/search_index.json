Github issue tracker \u00b6 Use the issue tracker on the Github repository to report bugs and propose enhancements/new features. Please check beforehand if the same bug has already been reported or the same enhancement has already been suggested. If so, use the existing ticket to add additional information or suggest improvements. This will make it easier for us to keep everything under control. Duplicates will usually be closed rapidly, but it always takes time to find them, which the develeopers would prefer to invest in coding and improving the documentation. Issues that are resolved will be closed as well. Open questions are better discussed on Github discussions. Gitter and Matrix channels \u00b6 If you want to discuss some topic related to Xournal++ in chat mode, you may find someone to talk with in the Gitter channel or in the Matrix channel . The Crowdin project \u00b6 Our translations are managed in the Crowdin project . If you would like to contribute, create an account and start contributing. While some languages like English, German and Italian are basically complete, most other languages still need more work. If you are interested in translating a new language, ask the project maintainers on Gitter or create a new issue and they will unlock the language on Crowdin. Github pull requests \u00b6 If you want to contribute to the codebase of Xournal++ you may create a pull request on Github . Once the pull request is ready for review, one of the developer team will review it, suggest changes if necessary or accept/decline the pull request.

Xournal \u00b6 Xournal++ started as a C++ rewrite of Xournal by Denis Aroux , which is programmed in C and hosted on sourceforge. Xournal++ is actively developed, while Xournal has stopped developing new features after mid 2016. Denis Aroux notes on the Xournal website : You may also want to try out Xournal++ (which started out as a rewrite of Xournal in C++, but now has evolved well beyond the original, while retaining a decent amount of compatibility). Xournal++ still uses some parts of Xournal's code, most notably Xournal's shape recogntion code. The two applications share a similar look. Xournal++ contains most of Xournal's functionality, while adding some useful pluses. Xournal++ can open Xournal .xoj-documents and export to it in compatibility mode. We are greatly thankful to Denis Aroux for his wonderful software and all of Xournal's contributors. The following lists highlight the differences between the latest development version Xournal++ 1.3.2+dev and Xournal 0.4.8.2016. Features available in Xournal++, but not in Xournal \u00b6 LaTeX tool Audio recording and playback Lua plugins Pen pressure support Sidebar with page and layer previews PDF text selection tool (copy, highlight, underline and strike through text) Ability to follow PDF hyperlinks and links to URLs Page layout in multiple rows/columns Grid and rotation snapping Select object tool Rectangle, Circle, Arrow, Coordinate system and Spline drawing types Set-square and compass tools for measurements or as a guide for drawing Flexible remapping of input devices Zoom gestures Drawing modifiers by drawing direction Export to .png and .svg , and various export options Document creation and export from command line Periodic autosave and auto-backup tool Staves and Isodotted page backgrounds More cursor icon options Floating toolbox Configurable toolbars Language selectable in the GUI Option to easily append new pdf pages Custom color palette support using the .gpl format Optional input stabilization More distribution options on Linux (PPA, flatpak, appimage and snap packages) Translations in more languages Features available in Xournal, but not in Xournal++ \u00b6 Input via Xinput (which gives better strokes on some devices) One page mode (useful in presentations) A complete documentation and a well documented file format Known issues/bugs/inconveniences of Xournal, resolved in Xournal++ \u00b6 TODO Performance comparision between Xournal++ and Xournal \u00b6 TODO Xournal++ mobile \u00b6 Xournal++ lacks the option to be used on mobile devices other than Linux phones. Xournal++ mobile tries to fill this gap. It ports the main features of Xournal++ to various Flutter platforms like Android, iOS and the Web. It uses the same .xopp file format as Xournal++ does. Xournal++ Mobile is currently still in early development. Don't expect a fully featured app, but rather a modern looking app to edit basic .xopp -files on the mobile phone or the Web. Strokes, images and LaTeX formulas can be rendered, PDF backgrounds not yet. Note Currently Xournal++ mobile is unmaintained and no new features have been added since March 2021. If anyone is interested in taking over maintanance, let us know. Linwood Butterfly \u00b6 If you are looking for a maintained and great looking open source note-taking app with mobile device support comparable to Xournal++ mobile, there is Linwood Butterfly . It has recently added an importer for Xournal++'s .xopp -files and is working on an exporter, too, according to the developer of this app. Like Xournal++ mobile, the app is Flutter-based and available for Android, Windows, Linux, and in the Web. So Linwood Butterfly is to be tried if you want to work with .xopp -files on a mobile device/on the web or if you simply prefer a more minimalistic app. Rnote \u00b6 Xournal++ is still working on its port to Gtk 4. Meanwhile Rnote is already built from scratch for Gtk 4. Look no further if you are seeking for a modern looking and featureful Gnome/Libadwaita based app with mostly the same purpose as Xournal++, but centered around an infinity canvas instead of page-based view. Rnote uses its own file format, yet offers import from and export to Xournal++'s .xopp -format. Mr Writer \u00b6 While Xournal++ and Xournal are based on GTK+ 3 and GTK+ 2, respecitively, Mr Writer is a QT-based App which shares a lot of functionality with Xournal and Xournal++. In the author's words: MrWriter is an application aiming to replace both pen and paper for handwritten note taking, as well as blackboards for giving lectures in front of students. It is highly inspired by Xournal / Xournal++ the focus is more on taking notes and platform independence, rather than PDF annotation. Xournal files (.xoj) can be imported, but only strokes get recognized. Mr Writer has its own file format, called .moj which Xournal++ is capable of opening directly. Moreover since Xournal++ can export to .xoj -files you also can basically also open files created by Xournal++ in Mr Writer. Joplin \u00b6 If you are looking for a text based note taking app with great organizational tools, you may want to try out Joplin . While Xournal++ excells in handwriting and PDF annotation, Joplin can organise your notes into notebooks in a nice tree structure and synchronize them via Cloud services like Nextcloud, Dropbox, OneDrive and WebDAV. You can attach all kind of files to a Joplin file, including Xournal++ .xopp -files. Xournal++ and Joplin complement each other pretty well, if you take handwritten notes in class (or elsewhere) and want to keep them nicely organized and synchronized. OBS Studio \u00b6 For creating video recordings or live streams of lectures that you present using Xournal++ we recommend to use OBS Studio . This free and open source tool is available on all major platforms.","title":"Xournal++ & other software"},{"location":"community/other-software/#relation-to-other-software","text":"This section is about the relation between Xournal++ and other open source software products, which either share a decent amount of similarity and compatibility or which can be combined nicely with Xournal++.","title":"Relation to other software"},{"location":"community/other-software/#xournal","text":"Xournal++ started as a C++ rewrite of Xournal by Denis Aroux , which is programmed in C and hosted on sourceforge.

The main way to interact with an external PDF file is to use the PDF file as the background of a journal. Setting a PDF file as a background \u00b6 To create a new journal that uses a PDF file as a background, you can use the menu option File > Annotate PDF or File > Open . This will open a dialog that will allow you to select a PDF file, and then it will create a new journal with that PDF file as the background. Note Xournal++ currently stores the journal file ( .xopp ) separately from the PDF file. When you save a journal file, the absolute path of the PDF file will be stored in the .xopp file. This means that if you move the .xopp file to another computer, or if you move the PDF to another location, Xournal++ will not be able to find your background PDF. When this happens, opening the journal file will lead to Xournal++ prompting you to either identify the new location of your PDF or select a new one. To work around this problem, you can use the PDF attach mode as described below. There are future plans to introduce a \"bundled\" file format that stores the journal and the PDF file in the same file. For more information, see this issue on our issue tracker . Attach mode \u00b6 If you use File > Annotate PDF to create a new journal, you can check the Attach file to the journal checkbox to enable \"attach mode\". When attach mode is enabled for a journal, the PDF file will always be copied to the same directory as the .xopp file when saving, even if the .xopp file is moved. Futhermore, the journal file will store a relative path to the PDF file. Together, this means that you can savely \"move\" a .xopp file that has a PDF background as long as you ensure that you \"move\" the file using File > Save As ! Bug In Xournal++ 1.1.1 and older, there was a bug where attach mode settings would not be remembered when loading. This bug has been fixed in Xournal++ 1.1.2. Navigating the PDF file \u00b6 If the PDF file contains a table of contents, the \"Outline\" tab of the sidebar will display the table of contents. Clicking on an entry in the \"Outline\" tab will jump the canvas to the corresponding page. Relationship between the Journal and the PDF background \u00b6 Due to the way Xournal++ works, there are several limitations on modifying journal pages or modifying the background PDF file: Because Xournal++ treats the background PDF file separately, changing the background PDF file may cause annotations to \"go out of sync\" with the background PDF. For example, if pages are removed from the background PDF, then the journal file will still contain pages referencing the removed pages. Xournal++ will not delete the annotations on those pages, but the (removed) pages will no longer be rendered. If pages are added to the background PDF file, Xournal++ will not automatically insert the newly added pages. The new pages must be inserted into the journal using the Journal > Append New PDF Pages menu option. Searching for PDF Text \u00b6 To search for text contained in a PDF background page, use Edit > Search or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl F . This will open a prompt that will allow you to search for the given text on all PDF pages. Interacting with PDF Pages \u00b6 Note This feature is only available in the nightly version. The PDF Toolbox feature can be used to interact with the background PDF pages. This feature is available through the following tools: Select Linear PDF Text: select lines of text on the PDF Select PDF Text in Rectangle: select text on the PDF using a rectangular cursor For more information, see the PDF Tools page. Exporting to PDF \u00b6 The journal file and its PDF background can be exported in the usual way using the File > Export as PDF menu option. Due to the way that Xournal++ deals with PDF files, there are several limitations on the export: Once you export annotations to PDF format, the annotations in the PDF file cannot be edited. This is because the PDF format is not designed to be edited. Xournal++'s PDF export does not preserve annotations that are built-in to the PDF file, such as pop-up notes and forms. Xournal++ will not allow you to override the background PDF when you export. This is because overriding the background PDF will cause the annotations in the journal to become inconsistent with the actual contents of the (newly overridden) background PDF. For a more detailed discussion of this problem, see this issue .","title":"Working With PDF Files"},{"location":"guide/pdfs/#working-with-pdf-files","text":"Xournal++ supports various features for annotating on top of PDF files.

If not, instructions can be found here . How Xournal++ works \u00b6 Xournal++ is a note-taking tool focused on handwritten notes and digital tablet/stylus input. To this end, notes are stored in files called Journals ( .xopp format). A journal can be thought of as a collection of pages of different formats and sizes. The pages themselves contain visual elements such as pen strokes, shapes, images, etc. To allow users to create, view, and edit journals, Xournal++ provides a graphical application (shown in the image below). The application is divided into the following sections: The canvas displays the currently loaded journal and allows the user to create, delete, or edit elements. The toolbars allow the user to select tools , which are used to create and modify elements. For example, the Pen Tool can be used to draw/write strokes. The Select Object Tool can be used to move, resize, and scale elements. One tool may be designated as the \"currently activated tool\" at any time. The sidebar is used to preview parts of the journal, including the pages and layers (see the section below). Furthermore, buttons at the bottom of the sidebar allow the user to create pages. The menubar contains a list of menus that provide access to less frequently used features, such as the Preferences window and the Plugin Manager. This is roughly all the information that the reader needs to know to get started with Xournal++. For example, suppose we want to create a stroke. To do this, select the Pen Tool with a mouse, and then hold the left mouse button down across some portion of the canvas. First time setup \u00b6 Due to the wide variety of input devices that exist, the default input device settings in Xournal++ may not be appropriate for your system. Here, we briefly highlight the settings that may need to be changed in order for Xournal++ to work correctly for you. Settings may be changed by accessing the Edit > Preferences button in the menu. Input device setup \u00b6 If you are unable to draw strokes or type characters in the Text Tool, check out the Input System tab. This will list the input devices that Xournal++ detects, as well as the default device class assigned to each device. If the device class is incorrect, you can override the device class using the drop down menu to the right. For example: If you are using a combined wireless USB mouse/keyboard device, you may need to switch the input device from Mouse or Keyboard to Mouse+Keyboard Combo . A drawing tablet stylus may be detected as a mouse, which means that pressure sensitivity will not work. To fix this, you may need to override the device as a Stylus . Temporary tool button bindings \u00b6 The primary \"button\" of each input device, such as the left mouse button or the stylus tip, will activate the currently selected tool when pressed. However, it is also possible to configure the input devices so that pressing a secondary button will temporarily activate a different tool. For example, the right mouse and middle mouse buttons are set to temporarily activate the Eraser and Hand tools (respectively) by default. Touchscreen \u00b6 By default, touch motions on touchscreen devices will pan or scroll the canvas. An alternate mode, called \"Touch Drawing\", causes touch motions to invoke the selected tool instead. This allows strokes to be drawn directly with touch motions. Creating your first document \u00b6 Now that we've set up the default settings, we are ready to start exploring how Xournal++ might actually be used. The typical workflow begins with creating a new journal or loading an existing one. The former can be achieved using the File > New menu item (or by clicking the New Document Button on the toolbar), and the latter can be done by using one of the File > Open options (or by clicking the Open File Button on the toolbar). To create a stroke, select the Pen Tool from the toolbar. Hold down your stylus or mouse on the screen to initiate a stroke, drag it to draw the stroke, and then lift it to end the stroke. You can change stroke attributes such as shape, color, and fill using some of the toggle buttons and drop down menus in the toolbar. Add a new page by clicking the Insert Page Button or using one of the Journal > New Page menu buttons. Save the journal to .xopp format using File > Safe or by clicking the Save Button . Using tools to create and manipulate elements \u00b6 The main way to create and manipulate visual elements is to use a set of tools that are built into the application. We've seen one such example above: the Pen Tool . Exactly one tool is marked \"selected\" at any given time, and the selected tool can be changed by pressing one of the tool buttons on the toolbar. Here is a list of some other commonly used tools: Tool Functionality Eraser Tool removes strokes Highlighter Tool like the Pen Tool but with transparent strokes (like a highlighter) Text Tool insert typed text (color and font are selectable) LaTeX Tool insert LaTeX formula or diagrams Select Object Tool selects objects, so they can be moved, scaled, or deleted Select Rectangle Tool select objects in a rectangular region Of special note are the family of \"select tools\" like Select Object Tool and Select Rectangle Tool , which are used to modify existing elements: Select one or more elements using Select Object Tool or Select Rectangle Tool . A pale blue rectangle called the selection rectangle will be drawn around them. Only one selection can be active at a time. To cancel a selection, press on an empty part of the page with a selection tool, or switch to another tool. Move the selected element(s) by pressing and holding them with your left mouse button / stylus. Scale the selected elements(s) by dragging one of the eight white boxes around the edges of the selection rectangle. Alternatively, drag an edge of the selection rectangle. Duplicate the selected element(s) by pressing the selection rectangle with the right mouse button (or button on stylus mapped to right mouse button). Delete the selected element(s) by pressing the red rectangle with a cross. Alternatively, press the Del button on your keyboard. Annotating PDF files \u00b6 In addition to creating journals from scratch, Xournal++ can also be used to \"annotate\" PDF files by creating journals that use a PDF file as a background. Use either File > Open or File > Annotate PDF to load a PDF file. \"Annotate\" the PDF pages by using tools such as the Highlighter Tool , Pen Tool , and Text Tool to add elements on top of the PDF pages. Save the journal to .xopp format using File > Safe or by clicking the Save Button . Note that the .xopp file requires the original PDF to be kept around. Exporting journals to other formats \u00b6 Xournal++ can export a journal file to many different file formats. Open a journal. Use File > Export to PDF to generate a PDF file from the journal. To export to other file formats such as SVG or PNG, or to set export options such as the specific pages to export, use File > Export As to choose the file format and then set the export options.","title":"Whirlwind Tour"},{"location":"guide/whirlwind-tour/#how-xournal-works","text":"Xournal++ is a note-taking tool focused on handwritten notes and digital tablet/stylus input.

Autosaves were previously in the Config folder in the subfolder autosave . Default Save Name \u00b6 Name that will be proposed by default when using Save As option. Allows the use of placeholders. Autoloading Journals \u00b6 TODO Input System \u00b6 The Input System tab is used to configure how to handle input devices such as mice, styluses, keyboards, and touchscreens. Overriding Device Classes \u00b6 By default, Xournal++ will guess the \"class\" of each physical input device that is recognized by your computer. Sometimes the guess will be wrong (e.g., if your stylus is detected as a touchscreen), in which case you may need to manually override device class in the Input Devices section. Each device recognized by Xournal++ will be displayed in the format of Name (guessed device type) , one per line. The right side of each line will have a dropdown menu that can be used to override the device class. The device classes are described below: Disabled : do not handle any input from the physical device. Mouse : treat the physical device like a mouse, but do not allow keyboard input from the physical device. Supports pressure sensitivity if assigned to a stylus. Mouse+Keyboard Combo : similar to mouse, but allow keyboard input. This device class should be used for wireless USB \"Mouse + Keyboard Combo\" devices, such as popular ones from Logitech. Pen : a stylus device tip. Supports pressure sensitivity. Eraser : forces all input from the physical device to be used with the Eraser Tool. Touchscreen : a touchscreen input. Supports pressure sensitivity and gestures. Note that each device class has its own tab in Preferences for additional configuration. Input Options \u00b6 When the Enable drawing outside window option is enabled (default), moving the input device out of the canvas will pause points from being added to the stroke until the input device reenters the canvas. When the option is disabled, the current stroke will be finalized when the input device leaves the canvas. For some stylus devices, stylus button presses may not be detected when the device is hovering. If you think this could be a hardware and not a driver problem, one potential workaround is to set the Merge button events with stylus tip events setting. This will cause Xournal++ to simulate a stylus tip press whenever a stylus button is pressed. Note that if your device already works properly with this setting off, turning it on can cause issues! Note On Windows, you are strongly recommended to turn this setting on. The reason is that the Windows Ink API is designed to only report stylus button input when the stylus tip is pressed down, so Xournal++ won't interpret the button events correctly unless the setting is turned on. If you're using Linux with an X11 environment, you will likely need to enable Merge button events with stylus tip events if xsetwacom get <id> TabletPCButton (where you can retrieve your stylus device id with xsetwacom --list devices ) reports that TabletPCButton is on. The information in this note is summarized from these comment threads on GitHub: #2316 (comment by rolandlo) #2316 (comment by lb90) #2496 If you are using an input device that is not pressure sensitive, the Enable Pressure Inference option can be used to guess pressure levels based on how quickly a stroke is drawn. Input Stabilization \u00b6 The Input Stabilization feature can be enabled to draw smoother strokes. This involves two parts: the averaging method and the preprocessor . Both are optional, but at least one should be enabled for smoothing to work. If you do not want to spend too much time tweaking the settings, a good starting point is to use Velocity based Gaussian weights averaging method and no preprocessor. You may want to enable a preprocessor if you are prone to jerking or jittering your input device. The averaging method is used to determine how to smooth out the strokes. Velocity based Gaussian weights saves a running history of the input locations and directions, which then adjusts the final position of the next point to add to the stroke. Arithmetic mean smooths the strokes by saving the history of the last few input locations (determined by the Buffersize parameter) and adding the arithmetic mean of those points to the stroke. This averaging method draws nice, smooth strokes, but this means that the last few points cannot be added to the stroke until the stroke is finalized, causing a noticable sluggishness when drawing. The preprocessor helps reduce the amount of jaggedness/jerkiness in a stroke: Inertia will reduce the amount of position change based on the speed at which the stroke is drawn (similar to how a spring works). This smooths strokes by reducing the effect of sudden jerking movements with the input device. The effect of the inertia preprocessor is determined by the parameters Mass (a constant amount of reduction) and Drag (reduction based on speed). Deadzone prevents small position changes from being added to the stroke, such as if the pen is jittered in the same location. The size of these \"small\" position changes is determined by the Radius parameter. For technical details about how the input stabilization works, see this comment on GitHub . Mouse \u00b6 In this section you can set the behavior of the middle and right mouse buttons to associate tools with it. Each tool allows sub settings for thickness, color, stroke type, etc. if they are available. Stylus \u00b6 Pressure Sensitivity \u00b6 Enables / disables pressure sensitivity to make thicker strokes when pressing the stylus more heavily. Only effective on tablets that support this feature. Artifact Workaround \u00b6 TODO Stylus Buttons \u00b6 Specifies the behavior of the buttons on the stylus when pressed, allowing them to be associated with tools just like the buttons on the mouse.

Using a text editor, open the toolbar.ini file contained in the Xournal++ config folder. See File locations for the location of this folder on your operating system. Find the section corresponding to your toolbar configuration, e.g. [My Toolbar] . Each line under this section header defines the tools used in each toolbar. Find the COLOR(0x??????) items on each line. The six question marks correspond to a color in RGB hexadecimal format. Replace these hexadecimal numbers with your desired colors. To find the right numbers, you can use an online hex RGB color picker tool such as this one . Toolbar Palette Files \u00b6 In this method, the color palette is set up by editing a GIMP color palette file. The palette will be loaded from a file named palette.gpl contained in the config folder . On the first run, Xournal++ will create this file for you with the default color palette. Thus, the easiest way to get started is to adjust this default file. Edit the palette.gpl file located in the config folder . Restart Xournal++ .gpl File Format \u00b6 Note The .gpl file format is not authoritatively defined anywhere, so the file format described below may be specific to Xournal++. However, Xournal++ tries to be compatible with .gpl files used with other software such as GIMP. If you find a .gpl file that works in other software but does not work with Xournal++, please file a bug report . As an example, the default color palette of Xournal++ is shown below. GIMP Palette Name: Xournal Default Palette # 0 0 0 Black 0 128 0 Green 0 192 255 Light Blue 0 255 0 Light Green 51 51 204 Blue 128 128 128 Gray 255 0 0 Red 255 0 255 Magenta 255 128 0 Orange 255 255 0 Yellow 255 255 255 White If no existing palette.gpl is found, palette.gpl will be created with the above contents. The palette file consists of several parts: Header : every palette file must begin with the line GIMP Palette , otherwise the file will not be a valid .gpl file. A list of attributes of the form Key: Value , one per line. These attributes are metadata that describe the palette. Lines beginning with # are comments , which are ignored by the file parser. The comment used above is to distinguish the attributes from the colors of the palette. The colors of the palette, one per line, in the format RRR GGG BBB Name . The RRR , GGG , and BBB correspond to the RGB format of the color, specified as base-10 integers in the range 0-255 . To find the right numbers, you can use an online RGB color picker tool such as this one . Note It's recommended to have at least 11 colors in a palette, as the default toolbar has 11 Color Items. If your palette has fewer colors, a warning will be displayed in the console, and the extra Color Items will cycle through the palette. If Xournal++ cannot parse the palette file (i.e., the palette file is invalid), it will load the default palette. If this happens, there are two ways to get your palette file to load. Option 1: Debugging : run xournalpp from the command line and check for an error message explaining why the palette file is invalid. Then, fix your palette.gpl file, restart Xournal++, and check if the palette loaded correctly. If not, repeat this debugging step. Option 2: Fresh Start : delete palette.gpl , restart Xournal++ to create a new default palette.gpl file, and edit again.

Plugins can be added without building Xournal++ from source. Their primary use is to add user-specific functionality, shortcuts, make calls to external programs, define user-specific export functions and the like. In general the Lua Plugin interface is still in an early stage and will be expanded over time. In order to use Lua Plugins make sure you have Lua (version >=5.3) installed on your device. Plugin manager \u00b6 Plugins must be activated or deactivated in the Plugin manager (from menu Plugin > Plugin manager ). The Plugin manager lists the installation folder, description, author and version for each plugin. Only activated plugins will be listed in the menubar and only those can be run. The other plugins are safely excluded. Note that a restart of Xournal++ is required to change the activation of a plugin. Installation folder \u00b6 Plugins shipped with Xournal++ reside in the same folder, the plugins subfolder of the shared recources folder . In the latest development version, custom plugins can be stored in the plugins subfolder of the config folder . Create the plugins subfolder manually, if it does not exist. Each plugin has its files stored in a subfolder of the plugin folder and contains at least a plugin.ini file and a Lua code file. Plugin structure \u00b6 The plugin.ini file contains the name of the author, the version number, info on whether it is enabled by default or not and a reference to the main Lua code file. A sample file (referencing main.lua ) is: plugin.ini \u00b6 [about] ## Author / Copyright notice author = NAME OF THE AUTHOR description = DESCRIPTION OF THE PLUGIN ## If the plugin is packed with Xournal++, use ## <xournalpp> then it gets the same version number version = <xournalpp> [default] enabled = false [plugin] mainfile = main.lua The Lua code file referenced in the plugin.ini file must define an initUi -function that registers toolbar actions and initializes all UI stuff. It is supposed to call the app.registerUi -function, whose argument is a Lua table containing the menu name displayed in Xournal++'s menubar, the callback function used when the plugin is called from the menu or via a keyboard accelerator, the accelerator used to execute the plugin callback function. The format looks like <Control>a or <Shift><Alt>F1 , see GTK4 reference for details. The accelerator can be omitted. Using accelerators without modifiers like ( <Alt> , <Control> , <Shift> ) is allowed, but will likely break the text tool. You can register multiple menu entires/accelators in the same plugin by using app.registerUi multiple times. A sample file for the main Lua code file is: main.lua \u00b6 -- Register all Toolbar actions and intialize all UI stuff function initUi () app . registerUi ({[ \"menu\" ] = \"NAME\" , [ \"callback\" ] = \"run\" , [ \"accelerator\" ] = \"<Alt>F1\" }); -- ADD MORE CODE, IF NEEDED end -- Callback if the menu item is executed function run () -- ADD CODE LIKE -- app.uiAction({[\"action\"]=\"ACTION_TOOL_PEN\"}) -- TO SWITCH TO THE PEN TOOL, OR -- app.changeToolColor({[\"color\"] = 0xff0000, [\"selection\"] = true}) -- TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE CURRENT TOOL TO RED end For more extensive examples of plugins, you can check out the code of the plugins bundled with Xournal++ in the repository . Plugin API \u00b6 Error-handling \u00b6 Functions of the xounalpp Lua-Api will return Lua errors which can be handled by calling the function with pcall when something unexpected happens (like wrong arguments passed). In rare cases nil, errorMessage might be returned to silently throwing an error. This is reserved for expected things (like the resource is unavailable). You may make such errors to Lua errors by wrapping with assert . Functions \u00b6 Any Lua Plugin can execute a number of Xournal++ functions to interact with Xournal++.Those are defined in the Plugin API as seen in the definition file . That file shows the list of all Xournal++ functions, its function parameters, return values and example usage. Moreover it can be used with the Lua language server to get code completion, hover tooltips, jump-to-definition, find-references, and more. For writing plugins using one of the many code editors that support the Lua language server is advisable. If you need more information how these Xournal++ functions are defined, see the luapi_application.h file which is relevant to your version of xournalpp: 1.1.x series 1.2.x series nightly builds Using plugins to define shortcuts for ui actions \u00b6 Currently Xournal++ does not have shortcuts/keybindings configurable in the preferences. However you can write your custom plugin to achieve exactly that. The function app.uiAction used for simulating a toolbar/menubar click can be used for lots of different actions. This command accepts a Lua table with keys \"action\" and \"enabled\" as its argument. The \"enabled\" key is set to true by default, so you can often omit it. The \"action\" key accepts one of the action strings listed in the source file ActionBackwardCompatibilityLayer.cpp . Note that the list of actions will change when new functionality is added to Xournal++. For example use: app . uiAction ({ action = \"ACTION_RULER\" }) to activate the ruler (for drawing line segments) or app . uiAction ({ action = \"ACTION_TOOL_FILL\" , enabled = false }) to turn off filling of shapes. Retrieving information about the document and iterating through pages and layers \u00b6 The app.getDocumentStructure function yields a Lua table of the following shape: { pages = { { pageWidth = number , pageHeight = number , isAnnoated = bool , pageTypeFormat = string , pdfBackgroundPageNo = integer ( 0 , if there is no pdf background page ), layers = { [ 0 ] = { isVisible = bool }, [ 1 ] = { isVisible = bool , isAnnotated = bool }, ... }, currentLayer = integer }, ... } currentPage = integer , pdfBackgroundFilename = string ( empty if there is none ) } So for example to get the number of all pages, the page number of the current page and the layer ID of the current layer use the code: local docStructure = app . getDocumentStructure () local numPages = # docStructure . pages local currPage = docStructure . currentPage local currLayer = docStructure . pages [ currPage ]. currentLayer You can iterate through all pages by using the lines local docStructure = app . getDocumentStructure () local numPages = # docStructure . pages for i = 1 , numPages do -- ADD CODE TO EXECUTE FOR PAGE i end Similarly you can run through all layers of a page. In case of the current page this would read like local docStructure = app . getDocumentStructure () local page = docStructure . currentPage local numLayers = # docStructure . pages [ page ]. layers for i = 1 , numLayers do -- ADD CODE TO EXECUTE FOR LAYER i end Using Lua modules \u00b6 More complex Plugins will require Lua modules for certain operations. For instance if your Plugin needs a more sophisticated GUI or wants to repeat tasks in predefined time intervals, you may want to use the lgi -module via require(\"lgi\") . The Lua package path by default contains the root folder of the plugin and the system Lua package path. In case you need other folders in the package path, use the package.path key to add them.","title":"Building plugins"},{"location":"guide/plugins/plugins/#building-plugins","text":"Xournal++ provides a basic Lua Plugin interface.

They can be used for measuring lengths of elements in the document and as a guide for drawing straight lines, circles or parts thereof. You can even do geometric constructions with them. Both geometry tools can be manipulated via touch on a touchscreen or via the keyboard. Drawing happens through the mouse, stylus, or touchscreen. Setsquare overview \u00b6 The setsquare is a ruler-like tool that is used to measure distances and angles and draw straight lines. The setsquare is shaped like an isosceles triangle. The longest side of the setsquare is used for measuring elements of the document and drawing straight lines aligned to it. There are marks (in green) parallel to the longest side of the setsquare, that allow measuring distances from that side. Angular marks (in purple) help measuring angles. The current rotation of the setsquare (in tenth of degrees) will be shown in a circular display, near the angle made by the two shorter sides of the setsquare. In the picture above, this angle is 10.0 degrees. The shorter two sides of the setsquare can be used to drawing lines from the middle point of the longest side of the setsquare. This can be activated by clicking/touching near the two shorter sides of the setsquare. Compass overview \u00b6 The compass is a wheel-shaped tool used to measure angles and draw circles/arcs/sectors. The compass can be used for drawing circles, arcs, and (when \"fill\" is enabled) circular sectors. To activate this feature, draw near the edge of the compass (but inside it). Lines can also be drawn along the axis marked with measuring marks. The radius of the compass/drawn circles can be seen from the last displayed measuring mark. Angular marks (in purple) help measuring angles. Like for the setsquare, there is a display of the current rotation of the compass. Units, distinguished point and axis \u00b6 For all geometry tools, lengths are measured in centimeters and angles are measured in degrees. Each geometry tool has a distinguished point and a distinguished axis through that point. The distinguished point is used as a rotation and scaling center when rotating/scaling via keyboard. Angles are measured between horizontal axis and distinguished axis. Setsquare : The distinguished axis and point are the longest side of the setsquare and its midpoint, respectively. Compass : Its distinguished point is the center of the compass wheel. The distinguished axis is a radius that carries measuring marks and can be used to draw a radius or part of it. Setup and activation \u00b6 In order to setup the geometry tools, check your Display DPI Calibration in the Zoom panel of menu Edit > Preferences to ensure that the length on your screen matches the physical length. Set the zoom to 100% to profit from the calibration. Switch one geometry tool on/off either from menu Tools or via the toolbar (setsquare/compass symbol). Only one geometry tool can be used at once. When a geometry tool is switched on while another one is active, the latter one is switched off. A geometry tool is always attached to one particular page of the document. If you need it on a different page of the document, deactivate it on the old one and activate it on the new one. This can be achieved by clicking twice on the corresponding symbol on the toolbar. The geometry tools are designed to be used either with touch (one hand) and stylus/mouse (other hand) or with keyboard (one hand) and stylus/mouse (other hand). Keyboard and Touch are used to move the geometry tool (and the page) around, to rotate it and change its size. All geometry tools react in the same way to keyboard and touch input. Stylus/Mouse are used to draw/annotate. Different geometry tools react differently to stylus/mouse input. Keyboard control \u00b6 Several keys can be used to move, rotate and scale the geometry tool. The Alt modifier can be used to get smaller steps. arrow keys for moving around. Steps are 0.25 cm (big) and 0.25 mm (small). Use the shift key to make the geometry tool move parallel or perpendicular to the longest side of the setsquare. r/R for rotation (countclockwise/clockwise) around the distinguished point. Steps are 5 degrees (big) and 0.2 degrees (small) s/S for scaling (up/down) centered at the distinguished point. Steps for scaling up are 10% (big) and 1% (small). Scaling down has the opposite effect. m for marking the distinguished point by adding a small \"x\" to the page. Touch control \u00b6 Touch can be used with one finger or two fingers. Gestures with more fingers are not handled. One finger touch \u00b6 Touch the geometry tool and move your finger around to move the geometry tool. If you move the distinguished point close to some line segment, the geometry tool will get rotation snapped to it, if its distinguished axis is at most 3 degrees from the line segment (or of a perpendicular line).

A touch sequence with two fingers, where the first finger touching the screen inside the geometry tool and the second finger outside the geometry tool leads to scrolling/resizing without rotation (and also no rotation snapping). Interaction with other tools \u00b6 When a geometry tool is activated, there are special Stylus/Mouse interactions with the Pen, Highlighter and Hand tool. Interaction with the Pen/Highlighter \u00b6 Setsquare \u00b6 Start a stroke inside the setsquare, not further than 0.5 cm from its longest side, to draw a line aligned to the longest side of the setsquare. It doesn't matter what drawing type you use. Start a stroke inside the setsquare, not further than 0.5 cm from one of the shorter sides, but outside the above mentioned region, to get a line from the chosen point to the midpoint of the longest side of the setsquare. Note that you can move the end point of that radial line around to get the desired length and angle. When the end point passes the semicircle with the measuring marks, the angle gets locked, so you have the chance to draw small radii without losing the precision for the angle in which it is drawn. Start a stroke outside the two regions described above to get normal drawing. This can be used for annotation. Compass \u00b6 Start a stroke inside the compass, not further than 0.5 cm from its border, to draw a circle arc aligned to the border. It doesn't matter what drawing type you use. Start a stroke near the distinguished axis with the measuring marks to draw a radial segment. Start a stroke outside the two regions described above to get normal drawing, used for annotation. Interaction with the Hand tool \u00b6 Use it in the inside of the geometry tool to move the geometry tool only.

In order to use this tool you must have LaTeX installed on your system. Note The screenshots on this page show the latest nightly version. In the latest nightly version, the preview dialog has a resizable window, word wrap, auto-indentation, and syntax highlighting. It also has a separate Command Output tab that displays the output from the LaTeX generator command (e.g. pdflatex ). Setup \u00b6 The LaTeX tool requires a TeX distribution to be installed on your computer. See this link for a guide on how to install one. Some distributions that have worked for users include MikTeX on Windows, MacTeX on macOS, and TeX Live on Linux. If you would prefer a more minimal TeX distribution that requires little space on your hard drive, use TinyTeX , which is available on Windows, macOS and Linux. Start with a minimal base and use tlmgr to install further packages. TinyTeX is also bundled with the Snap package on Linux. Check out this file for a list of TeX packages installed with it. Once you have installed a TeX distribution, you can check if it works correctly from the Preferences window. This can be done by accessing Edit > Preferences from the menu and clicking on the Test configuration button in the LaTeX tab. Frequently encountered setup problems \u00b6 pdflatex or kpsewhich cannot be found : make sure that a TeX distribution is installed on your computer, and check that you are able to run LaTeX outside of Xournal++. If you have just installed MikTeX on Windows, you may need to run MikTeX at least once to install the necessary programs. The package standalone cannot be found : Xournal++ uses the TeX package standalone in order to render formulas. Please make sure the TeX distribution that you are using has the standalone package installed (if you are using TeX Live, you may need to install the extra packages to get standalone ). The LaTeX tool doesn't work with the Flatpak installation : The Flatpak version requires the Flathub TeX Live extension, which can be installed with the command: flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.texlive//21.08 The LaTeX tool doesn't work with the AppImage : The .AppImage is a compressed file that contains the default template and legacy template, but these files cannot be accessed. Please copy the default template or legacy template either by extracting the .AppImage or by downloading it from the github page . I still get an error even when pdflatex and standalone are installed : The default template makes use of the scontents package, which may not be included with your TeX distribution. Try changing the template file to the legacy_template.tex that is in the same location as default_template.tex , which should not use the scontents package. If you have any further issues, feel free to ask for help . Basic LaTeX formulas \u00b6 Clicking on the LaTeX button in the toolbar will bring up a dialog which will allow you to type in a formula. A preview will be displayed in the center of the dialog, which will keep updating as you type and indicate whether your formula is valid. Once you are done, you can click the OK button to insert the LaTeX into the document; the rendered formula will appear at the center of the current page. The formula can be selected, moved scaled and edited as desired. Note that the LaTeX formula will always be set in inline math mode . If you want to exit math mode, you should write a $-sign to leave math mode and add another $-sign at the end to reenter math-mode. For instance the LaTeX formula $ \\huge $ x ^ 2 will use the command \\huge to increase the font size, which cannot be done in math mode. Customization of the template \u00b6 The LaTeX formulas are rendered by substituting the user-provided formula (along with other information like tool color) into a template file . The template file to use can be changed in the LaTeX tab of the Preferences window. A default LaTeX template is provided under the name default_template.tex . Clicking on it, you will find its location in your file system (within the shared resources folder ). To generate a custom LaTeX template, make a copy of the default template, save it under a different name, and customize it. Some suggestions are listed here: Include the graphicx package by adding \\usepackage{graphicx} to your template file. As an example this will give you the possibility to add rotated text via a LaTeX formula like \\text { \\rotatebox [origin=c] { 90 }{ My Rotated Text }} Include the TikZ package via \\usepackage{tikz} for creating drawings with the powerful TikZ tool. A simple example would be to draw a table (or grid) with n rows and m columns via \\tikz{\\draw (0,0) grid(m,n)} . See this issue for more information. With TikZ included, also include the PGFPlots package via \\usepackage{pgfplots} for plotting function graphs. Using a macro, you will be able to plot function graphs nicely and very quickly. For example, add the following lines to your template: %for defining commands \\usepackage { xargs } % for drawing and plotting \\usepackage { pgfplots } \\pgfplotsset { compat=newest } % Allows to place the legend below plot \\newcommandx { \\graph } [3][1=,2=] { \\begin { tikzpicture } \\begin { axis } [xlabel= $ x $ ,ylabel= $ y $ , axis lines=center,samples=100, #2] \\addplot [#1] { #3 } ; \\end { axis } \\end { tikzpicture } } Then a LaTeX-formula like \\graph{x^2} will plot the normal parabola and \\graph[domain=-2:2, blue][x=1cm,y=1cm]{x^2} will further restrict the domain, set the color and define units. Include the Listings package via \\usepackage{listings} for proper alignment and syntax coloring of code snippets. You need to define the style with lstset as in the following example, which you can add to your template: \\usepackage { listings } \\lstset { language=C++, basicstyle= \\ttfamily , keywordstyle= \\color { blue } \\ttfamily , stringstyle= \\color { red } \\ttfamily , commentstyle= \\color { green } \\ttfamily , morecomment=[l][ \\color { magenta } ] { \\# } } In the LaTeX formula you can then use the lstlistings enivronment as in the following example $ \\begin {lstlisting} #include<stdio.h> #include<iostream> // A comment int main ( void ) { printf ( \"Hello World \\n \" ) ; return 0 ; } \\end {lstlisting} $ Note that the starting and trailing $-signs are needed to exit and reenter math mode. Include the chemfig package via \\usepackage{chemfig} for drawing chemical molecules. For example to draw an ethanal molecule, use the LaTeX formula \\chemfig { H-C(-[2]H)(-[6]H)-C(=[1]O)-[7]H } Include the circuitikz package via \\usepackage{circuitikz} for drawing electric circuits. This can be used as in the following example: \\begin { circuitikz } [american] \\draw (0,0) to[isource, l= $ I_ 0 $ ] (0,3) to[short, -*, i= $ I_ 0 $ ] (2,3) to[R= $ R_ 1 $ , i> _ = $ i_ 1 $ ] (2,0) -- (0,0); \\draw (2,3) -- (4,3) to[R= $ R_ 2 $ , i> _ = $ i_ 2 $ ] (4,0) to[short, -*] (2,0); \\end { circuitikz } Include the xskak package via usepackage{xskak} for drawing chess positions.

Both pen and highlighter can be used with various colors and thicknesses. In fill mode the enclosed area will automatically be filled. The pen and highlighter tool can also draw various shapes (squares and rectangles, ellipses and circles, arrows, line segments, coordinate systems and splines) instead of strokes. Some of these shapes (line segments, rectangles and circles) can also be automatically recognized using the stroke recognizer. To change the color of any selected stroke or any future strokes you draw, click on one of the color buttons. Besides the preset color buttons, you can also set a custom color by clicking on the Select color button. The fill mode can be toggled by selecting the paint bucket icon (in the default layout, it is to the left of the color buttons). To change the thickness , press one of the thickness buttons (in the default layout, they are to the left of the fill bucket button). In order to draw shapes instead of strokes or to turn on the stroke recognizer use the shapes toggle menu, which you find to the right of the LaTeX tool (Math TEX button) in the default layout. The shapes toggle menu will have a dropdown arrow on its right. The shape modes can be used as follows: Shapes defined by two points \u00b6 In order to draw a line segment or an arrow click at the location of the first point (tail) and drag the cursor to the location of the second end point (head). Ellipses/circles and rectangles/squares can be drawn in similar fashion. These shapes will be symmetrical with respect to the horizontal and vertical axis. The first point can be either the center of the shape or one of the corners (of the surrounding rectangle/square in case of an ellipsis/circle). The second point will always be one of the corners. Pressing the control key will make this shape been drawn from the center , pressing the shift key will make it a perfect circle/square . If you do not want to use the keyboard for these modifiers, you can activate the drawing direction modifiers in the preferences (drawing area panel). Draw UP from the start point if you want the start point to be the center of the shape. Draw LEFT from the start point if you want the shape to be a circle/square. The coordinate system is a simple L-shape. Modifiers can be applied like for ellipses/circles and rectangles/squares. Splines \u00b6 With the spline shape you can draw polygon courses and smooth curves. Technically these curves are splines consisting of Bezier curve segments of degree at most 3. In order to draw a polygon course you simply click (and immediately release) on the locations where you want the vertices of your polygon course. For drawing a smooth curve you should always drag the mouse/stylus a little after clicking on the locations through which the curve shall pass. The curve will be tangent to the direction you drag out at the chosen points though which the curve passes. You can also combine linear spline segments with curved segments. The points where you click are called anchor points (or knots). They will be displayed with little red circles while editing the spline. The directions you drag out will be displayed as tangents in green color. Technically the two ends of the tangent are control points of the spline. You have several ways of correcting the last anchor point and the last tangent. Press the ARROW keys to move the last anchor point around. Use the keys r (respecitvely Shift + r ) to rotate the tangent (counter) clockwise. Use the keys s (respectively Shift + s ) to scale the last tangent up or down. You can also completely remove the last anchor point (and the corresponding tangent) via the BACKSPACE key. Drawing a spline is finished by either connecting the curve up to the first vertex/anchor point (yielding a closed spline), by double clicking or using the ESCAPE key. Stroke recognizer \u00b6 If the stroke recognizer is turned on, it will attempt to convert every stroke upon completion into either a line segment, a circle or a (possibly rotated) rectangle/square. It will leave the stroke as-is if it cannot match the stroke to one of these shapes.","title":"Pen and Highlighter tools"},{"location":"guide/tools/pen/#pen-and-highlighter-tools","text":"The pen and highlighter tools allow you to write , annotate the document and create various shapes using a mouse or a pressure-sensitive stylus. Both pen and highlighter can be used with various colors and thicknesses. In fill mode the enclosed area will automatically be filled. The pen and highlighter tool can also draw various shapes (squares and rectangles, ellipses and circles, arrows, line segments, coordinate systems and splines) instead of strokes. Some of these shapes (line segments, rectangles and circles) can also be automatically recognized using the stroke recognizer. To change the color of any selected stroke or any future strokes you draw, click on one of the color buttons. Besides the preset color buttons, you can also set a custom color by clicking on the Select color button. The fill mode can be toggled by selecting the paint bucket icon (in the default layout, it is to the left of the color buttons). To change the thickness , press one of the thickness buttons (in the default layout, they are to the left of the fill bucket button). In order to draw shapes instead of strokes or to turn on the stroke recognizer use the shapes toggle menu, which you find to the right of the LaTeX tool (Math TEX button) in the default layout. The shapes toggle menu will have a dropdown arrow on its right. The shape modes can be used as follows:","title":"Pen and Highlighter tools"},{"location":"guide/tools/pen/#shapes-defined-by-two-points","text":"In order to draw a line segment or an arrow click at the location of the first point (tail) and drag the cursor to the location of the second end point (head). Ellipses/circles and rectangles/squares can be drawn in similar fashion. These shapes will be symmetrical with respect to the horizontal and vertical axis. The first point can be either the center of the shape or one of the corners (of the surrounding rectangle/square in case of an ellipsis/circle). The second point will always be one of the corners. Pressing the control key will make this shape been drawn from the center , pressing the shift key will make it a perfect circle/square . If you do not want to use the keyboard for these modifiers, you can activate the drawing direction modifiers in the preferences (drawing area panel). Draw UP from the start point if you want the start point to be the center of the shape. Draw LEFT from the start point if you want the shape to be a circle/square. The coordinate system is a simple L-shape. Modifiers can be applied like for ellipses/circles and rectangles/squares.","title":"Shapes defined by two points"},{"location":"guide/tools/pen/#splines","text":"With the spline shape you can draw polygon courses and smooth curves. Technically these curves are splines consisting of Bezier curve segments of degree at most 3. In order to draw a polygon course you simply click (and immediately release) on the locations where you want the vertices of your polygon course. For drawing a smooth curve you should always drag the mouse/stylus a little after clicking on the locations through which the curve shall pass. The curve will be tangent to the direction you drag out at the chosen points though which the curve passes. You can also combine linear spline segments with curved segments. The points where you click are called anchor points (or knots). They will be displayed with little red circles while editing the spline. The directions you drag out will be displayed as tangents in green color. Technically the two ends of the tangent are control points of the spline. You have several ways of correcting the last anchor point and the last tangent. Press the ARROW keys to move the last anchor point around. Use the keys r (respecitvely Shift + r ) to rotate the tangent (counter) clockwise. Use the keys s (respectively Shift + s ) to scale the last tangent up or down. You can also completely remove the last anchor point (and the corresponding tangent) via the BACKSPACE key.

Specifically the following interactions and objects are supported: Strokes : can be copied, cut, erased, moved, resized, and rotated. Images, LaTeX and text : can be copied, cut, deleted, moved and resized. Pdf : currently not compatible with any selection tool. Object selection can be done with one of the following tools: Select Rectangle : creates a rectangular region from a corner while dragging and selecting all objects strictly within it. Select region : works like a pen, where your stroke creates a shadow around the region you enclose. Again, all objects must be completely covered with this shadow to be included in the selection. Select object : select only one object at a time. You just need to touch the object to select. When an object is clicked with the Select Region or Select Rectangle tool, the touched object is selected; that is, they work like the object selection tool. You can simplify the selection of single objects by enabling Tap action in the preferences (drawing area panel) and the \"Try to select object first\" checkbox. If activated you can select single objects simply by tapping (short clicking) on them regardless of the tool that is currently in use. Snapping tools \u00b6 The Snapping tools correct and adjust the displacement, size and rotation angle of selected objects. Drawing of shapes and (optionally) recognized shapes are also affected. Grid Snapping \u00b6 Grid Snapping makes the displacements of objects and lines made with the tools mentioned above fit with the grid of the page. This grid matches by default the Graph background grid, but it continues to exist internally even with other backgrounds. When you resize with Grid Snap enabled, the resize will attempt to match the grid line, no matter which side of the object. Similarly if you displace a selection by dragging it, it will attempt to match a grid point. Hold the selection near the corner that needs to be matched. Technically Xournal++ computes a minimal rectangle that contains all the objects of the selection. This rectangle is a bit smaller than the one you get display for manipulating the selection. The corner of this smaller rectangle which is closest to the cursor position will get matched. Rotation Snapping \u00b6 Rotation Snapping allows rotations of selected objects and strokes made with the tools mentioned above to be snapped to predetermined angles. These default angles correspond to multiples of 15 degrees. This allows you e.g. to easily rotate some strokes or shapes around 45 degrees, 60 degrees or 90 degrees. Configuration \u00b6 Both tools have a tolerance that can be configured in the preferences (Drawing Area panel, section Snapping). Higher values correspond to greater intensity in the effect. On the extrema, tolerance 1.0 means that all objects will get snapped; tolerance 0.0 means that no objects will get snapped. The Snapping effect is disabled by default for shape recognition, but it can be activated in the same section. Note that in the Grid Snapping description it is mentioned that the grid matches by default the grid of the Graph background. This grid consists of squares with side length 0.5 cm. By means of the Grid size parameter it is possible to change the side length of the grid squares as a multiple of the original length. In this way, for example, by setting 0.5 in the parameter, the internal grid becomes squares half the size of the Graph paper grid background, so the objects will try to fit not only the lines of the squares, but also with its halves.","title":"Selection and Snapping tools"},{"location":"guide/tools/selecsnap/#selection-snapping-tools","text":"","title":"Selection &amp; Snapping tools"},{"location":"guide/tools/selecsnap/#selection-tools","text":"With the selection tools you can either select a single object or multiple objects of the page in order to interact with them.
