- The [QuickSnapshot plugin](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/tree/master/plugins/QuickScreenshot)
uses an external screenshot tool, to quickly take a screen snapshot of a region of the screen and either put
it on the clipboard or save it into a user specified file.

provides a shortcut for toggling between "grid background with snapping to grid" and
"plain background without snapping to grid".

- The [LayerActions plugin](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/tree/master/plugins/LayerActions)
