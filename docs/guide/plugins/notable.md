# Notable Plugins

- The `QuickSnapshot` Plugin uses an external screenshot tool, to quickly take a screen snapshot of a region of the screen and save it into a user specified file
- The `ToggleGrid` Plugin provides a shortcut for toggling between "grid background with snapping to grid" and "plain background without snapping to grid"
- The `ColorCycle`Plugin lets you cycle through a list of colors for the current tool by using the same accelerator repeatedly
- The `LayerActions` Plugin provides shortcuts for cloning non-background layers to the next page, hiding all non-background layers except the footer layers and adding a new top layer on each page.
- The `MigrateFontSizes` Plugin allows to scale font sizes across the document, both via the GUI and directly from the menu.
- The `HandwritingRecognition` Plugin ([work in progress](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/pull/2176)) uses cloud-based handwriting recogntion to recognize handwritten text from a selection or page layer in a user-specified language.
