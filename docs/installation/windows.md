## General information

Xournal++ is a free and open source program and can be easily compiled from source, although for user convenience it is also distributed via precompiled binary (in .exe form). In case you want to compile xournalpp on your own you should follow the guide on the [github page](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/blob/master/readme/WindowsBuild.md). If you decide to do otherwise, then this guide is dedicated to that process.
