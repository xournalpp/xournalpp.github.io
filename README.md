# Xournal++ Website

This is the repository for the Xournal++ website. A push to the `site` branch
will automatically cause the website to be deployed to `master` branch.

The website is generated by [MkDocs][mkdocs]. If you would like to help revise
the website, feel free to [submit a pull
request](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp.github.io/pulls)!

## How to contribute

If you want to edit a single page individually, just navigate to the page on
GitHub and click the edit button; this will allow you to submit a pull request
(PR). Once you've submitted a PR, a maintainer will look over it and then merge
it after reviewing it and giving some feedback.

If you're editing multiple pages, it might be more useful to preview the site
locally. To do this, make sure to install [MkDocs][mkdocs],
the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)
and [macros plugin](https://mkdocs-macros-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#mkdocs-macros),
and clone this repository. Then, you can run `mkdocs serve` to start up a webserver
that hosts your local version of the website, which you can access from
`https://localhost:8080`.
